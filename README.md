The project guidelines are available [here](/subjects/en.subject.pdf); note that this repository is NOT fully-compliant with the requirements, mainly for organizational purposes.
Students, be aware, if you steal my code, you'll face the consequences ðŸ˜ˆ

I strictly follow the *Norm* enforced by the school. The Norm is a laundry list of coding conventions that students have to follow to the letter on pain of seeing their work sanctioned with a 0. The Norm forbids for instance the use of `goto`, `do while` and `for` loops, requires to declare every variable at the top of a function, and restrains the number of lines, columns and routines. Such restrictions are sometimes leading to the use of obscure code golf tricks ðŸ˜…
